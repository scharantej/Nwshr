**Flask Application Design: Displaying Recent News Articles**

**HTML Files**

- **index.html**: This file will serve as the home page of the application. It will display the most recent news articles fetched from a chosen news API. The page should contain elements to display the title, description, and publication date of each article.

**Routes**

- **GET /news**: This route will be responsible for fetching news articles from the API and rendering the index.html page with the retrieved articles. The route should use Flask's request and render_template() functions to accomplish this.
- **GET /article/<id>**: This route will handle requests for individual news articles. It will retrieve the article with the specified ID from the API and render a detailed article page displaying the full content of the article. Again, request and render_template() will be utilized here.
- **GET /about**: This route will display an "About" page providing information about the application, its purpose, and potential future developments. It will use render_template() to display an appropriate HTML file containing this information.

**Additional Considerations**

- The application should utilize Jinja2 templating to dynamically generate the HTML content from the data retrieved from the API.
- The choice of news API and the methods used to fetch and parse the data should be carefully evaluated to ensure the application delivers up-to-date and reliable news articles.
- To enhance the user experience, consider incorporating pagination, search functionality, and the ability to favorite or share articles. These features would increase the application's usability and engagement.
